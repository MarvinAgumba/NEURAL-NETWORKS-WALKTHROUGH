# NEURAL NETWORKS

## Introduction
Neural networks are becoming increasingly popular and are responsible for some of the most cutting-edge advancements in data science including image and speech recognition. They have also been transformative in reducing the need for intensive and often time-intensive feature engineering needed for traditional supervised learning tasks. In this lesson, we'll investigate the architecture of neural networks.

Types of neural networks: 
- Standard neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks (input = images, video)
- Recurrent neural networks (input = audio files, text, time series data)
- Generative adversarial networks
